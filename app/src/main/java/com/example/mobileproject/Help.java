        "The MBTI personality test helps you identify four basic areas of your personality.\n" +
        "1. Interaction with the world\n" +
        "2. Absorption of information\n" +
        "3. Decision-making\n" +
        "4. Organization\n" +
        "These four areas each have a polar dimension.\n" +
        "1. Extroversion vs. Introversion (E vs. I)\n" +
        "2. Sensing vs. Intuition (S vs. N)\n" +
        "3. Thinking vs. Feeling (T vs. F)\n" +
        "4. Judging vs. Perceiving (J vs. P)\n" +
        "E vs. I\n" +
        "• Extroversion describes a person who is energized by others, enjoys a variety of tasks, a quick pace, and is good at multitasking.\n" +
        "• Introversion describes a person who often likes working alone or in small groups, prefers a more deliberate pace, and likes to focus on one task at a time.\n" +
        "S vs. N\n" +
        "• Sensing describes are person who is realistic and likes to focus on the facts and details. Such a person would apply common sense and past experience to come up with practical solutions to problems.\n" +
        "• Intuition type people prefer to focus on possibilities and the big picture. They can easily see patterns, value innovation and seek creative solutions to problems.\n" +
        "T vs. F\n" +
        "• Thinking type people tend to make decisions using logical analysis, know how to objectively weigh pros and cons, and value honesty, consistency, and fairness.\n" +
        "• Feeling describes people who tend to be sensitive and cooperative. They base their decisions on their own personal values and how others will be affected by their actions.\n" +
        "J vs. P\n" +
        "• Judging describes a person who tends to be organized and prepared, likes to make and stick to plans, and is comfortable following most rules.\n" +
        "• Perceiving type people prefer to keep their options open, like to be able to act spontaneously, and like to be flexible with making plans.\n" +
        "It is important to keep in mind that each dimension reveals how a person is most comfortable operating, but it does not mean they will necessarily always possess their assumed dimension.\n" +
